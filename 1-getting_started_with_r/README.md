# 1. Getting Started With R
Welcome to your first data lesson in R! R is a programming language that was initially designed by statisticians and mathematicians out of the need to solve their complex algorithmic problems. Many believe R is one of the best languages to perform data analysis with - in a 2018 survey conducted by Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science, R was the third most popular language used by data scientists and data analysts (trailing only Python and SQL).

## 1.1 Installation of R
Let's get started by preparing our device for use in the R language.

* Download the Interactive Development Enviroment (IDE) [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
* Open RStudio via your Launchpad
  * I'd recommend keeping it in your dock, or at least remember you can easily open it up by pressing `Cmd + Space` and typing **RStudio**.
